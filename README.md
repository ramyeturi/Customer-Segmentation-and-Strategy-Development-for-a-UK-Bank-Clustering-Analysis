# Customer-Segmentation-and-Strategy-Development-for-a-UK-Bank-Clustering-Analysis
Abstract:

This project focuses on customer segmentation and strategy development for a UK bank, leveraging data from 600 customers stored in the "bankcustomers.csv" dataset. The dataset includes various customer attributes such as age, gender, region, income, marital status, children, car ownership, savings, checking accounts, mortgages, and personal equity plans (PEP).

Summary:

Data Preprocessing: We initiate the analysis by preprocessing the data. Since the "region" attribute is categorical, we perform one-hot encoding, creating four new binary variables representing inner city, town, rural, and suburban regions. This allows us to effectively analyze the data without region as a categorical feature.

Hierarchical Clustering: We apply hierarchical clustering to the dataset using five different linkage methods: centroid, single, complete, average, and Ward linkage. For each approach, we assess the presence of clear customer clusters and recommend the optimal number of clusters based on the characteristics of the clusters identified. We compare the performance of these methods to determine the most suitable one.

K-Means Clustering: Next, we implement k-means clustering with varying values of k (4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and consider the number of clusters suggested by the hierarchical clustering results. We evaluate the visibility of clear clusters for each k value, recommend the optimal number of clusters, and identify distinguishing characteristics within each cluster. We also compare these results with the hierarchical clustering outcomes to determine the preferable method.

Strategic Implications: As the bank's manager, we consider how the results of the clustering analysis can inform strategic planning. We explore innovative strategies, such as targeted marketing, product offerings, and customer engagement, based on the identified customer segments. This open-ended question encourages forward-thinking and innovative solutions to leverage customer segmentation for the bank's benefit.

This project aims to empower the bank with valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences, facilitating data-driven strategic planning and enhancing customer satisfaction and engagement.
